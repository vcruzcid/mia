# MIA React App - Task Completion Checklist

## Before Committing Code

### 1. Code Quality Checks
```bash
# Run TypeScript compiler check
npx tsc --noEmit

# Run ESLint
npm run lint

# Ensure build succeeds
npm run build
```

### 2. Testing
```bash
# Test development server
npm run dev

# Test production build
npm run preview

# Manual testing checklist:
- [ ] All pages load correctly
- [ ] Forms validate properly
- [ ] Responsive design works on mobile
- [ ] Navigation functions properly
- [ ] External links work (Stripe, etc.)
```

### 3. Code Review Items
- [ ] No unused imports or variables
- [ ] Proper TypeScript types for all props/functions
- [ ] Spanish text for user-facing content
- [ ] Consistent formatting and naming conventions
- [ ] No console.log statements in production code
- [ ] Error handling implemented for forms
- [ ] Accessibility considerations (alt tags, aria labels)

### 4. Performance Checks
- [ ] Bundle size reasonable (check with `npm run build`)
- [ ] No unnecessary re-renders in React components
- [ ] Images optimized and properly sized
- [ ] Only necessary dependencies included

### 5. Security Considerations
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets in code
- [ ] Form validation on both client and server side
- [ ] HTTPS links for external services
- [ ] Input sanitization for user data

## After Task Completion
1. **Build verification**: `npm run build` must succeed
2. **Documentation**: Update README.md if new features added
3. **Git workflow**: Proper commit messages describing changes
4. **Deployment**: Ready for production deployment to Vercel/Netlify

## Common Issues to Check
- **Import errors**: Check all imports resolve correctly
- **Type errors**: Ensure TypeScript compilation succeeds
- **CSS issues**: Verify Tailwind classes are working
- **Route issues**: Test all navigation links work correctly
- **Form submission**: Ensure forms handle errors gracefully
