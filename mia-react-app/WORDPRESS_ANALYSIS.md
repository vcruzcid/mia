## Data Migration Strategy

### 1. **Member Data Export**
```bash
# Export all member custom fields
wp post list --post_type=socias --format=csv --fields=ID,post_title,post_status

# Export member metadata
wp post meta list [POST_ID] --format=json

# Export user accounts
wp user list --role=socia_profesional --format=json
```

### 2. **Taxonomy Migration**
```bash
# Export professional categories
wp term list profesion-principal --format=json

# Export geographic data
wp term list pais-socia --format=json
```

### 3. **Media Migration**
- Member profile photos
- CV attachments
- Featured images

## Technical Implementation Notes

### WordPress Views Translation
The WordPress Views system uses shortcodes like:
```php
[wpv-view name='listado-socias-publico']
[wpv-filter-search-box output="bootstrap"]
[wpv-control-post-taxonomy taxonomy="profesion-principal"]
```

React equivalent would use:
```tsx
<MemberGallery 
  searchEnabled={true}
  filters={['profession', 'role', 'location']}
  layout="grid"
/>
```

### Database Schema Considerations
WordPress uses:
- `wp_posts` table for member entries
- `wp_postmeta` for custom fields
- `wp_term_relationships` for taxonomies

React app should consider:
- Normalized database schema
- Proper indexing for search
- Relationship management

## Conclusion

The WordPress site has a **sophisticated member management system** far exceeding the current React implementation. The migration should be **phased** to gradually implement the advanced features while maintaining the modern UI/UX advantages of the React app.

**Priority Order:**
1. Enhanced member profiles and data structure
2. Advanced filtering and search capabilities  
3. Administrative tools and role-based access
4. Privacy controls and consent management
5. Complete e-commerce integration

The current React implementation provides an excellent **foundation** with modern technology stack, API architecture, and user experience. The WordPress analysis reveals the **depth of functionality** needed for a complete member portal system.
