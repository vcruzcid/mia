# Supabase Setup Guide for MIA React App

Your application is now configured with Supabase credentials. Follow these steps to complete the setup.

## ✅ Completed Steps

1. **Environment Configuration**: `.env.local` created with your Supabase credentials
2. **Data Export**: 329 members exported from WordPress 
3. **Data Transformation**: All member data transformed to Supabase format
4. **Mock Data Removal**: Application updated to use real database integration

## 🔧 Required Manual Steps

### Step 1: Apply Database Schema

1. **Open your Supabase Dashboard**:
   - Go to: https://sggnohsrpdhbsavzccfw.supabase.com/dashboard/project/sggnohsrpdhbsavzccfw

2. **Navigate to SQL Editor**:
   - In the left sidebar, click "SQL Editor"
   - Click "New Query"

3. **Copy and Execute the Schema**:
   - Copy the entire contents of `supabase/schema.sql`
   - Paste into the SQL Editor
   - Click "Run" to execute

   **⚠️ Important**: The schema file contains all necessary tables, security policies, and functions.

### Step 2: Import Member Data

After applying the schema successfully, run:

```bash
node scripts/import-members-to-supabase.js
```

This will import all 329 members into your database.

### Step 3: Verify Setup

Once both steps are complete, you can:

1. **Test the application**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Check member data** in your Supabase dashboard:
   - Go to "Table Editor" → "members"
   - Verify 329 records exist
