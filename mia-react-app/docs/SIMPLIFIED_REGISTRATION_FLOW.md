# Simplified Registration Flow - Collect User Info from Stripe

## Overview

This approach inverts the traditional registration flow by collecting minimal information upfront and getting detailed user information from Stripe after payment completion. This reduces friction and improves conversion rates.

## Flow Comparison

### Traditional Flow (Previous):
1. User fills extensive form (personal info, address, categories, etc.)
2. User proceeds to payment
3. User re-enters information at Stripe checkout
4. Payment completion

### Simplified Flow (New):
1. User selects membership type only
2. User accepts terms and proceeds to payment
3. Stripe collects all necessary information during checkout
4. Backend retrieves user information from Stripe
5. Welcome page displays collected information
6. Optional: User completes extended profile later

## Key Benefits

### User Experience
- **Faster Registration**: Only membership selection required upfront
- **Less Friction**: No long forms to complete before payment
- **No Duplicate Entry**: Information entered once at Stripe
- **Mobile Optimized**: Stripe's optimized checkout forms
- **Higher Conversion**: Fewer abandonment opportunities

### Business Benefits
- **Improved Conversion Rates**: Fewer steps to payment
- **Better Data Quality**: Stripe validates information
- **Reduced Support**: Less form validation issues
- **Faster Time-to-Revenue**: Quicker payment completion

### Technical Benefits
- **Simpler Frontend**: Less complex form validation
- **Better Error Handling**: Stripe handles payment errors
- **Automatic Address Validation**: Stripe validates addresses
- **PCI Compliance**: Stripe handles sensitive data
- **International Support**: Stripe handles global payments
